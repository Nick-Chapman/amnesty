Reinstate speed measuring (with/out SDL)

Dump nametable for game-attract screen and level 1 from honesty
Run dumped nametable in amnesty, for visual comparison
PPU generate picture using pallet info in nametable(attribute part)

PPU use regs to track h/v scan counting
Speed up! (do I need compilation already!)

Use regs to store key-last-state and so detect edges.
Key/Reg to control other features such as flip.
AvsB reg when refactoring code to visually (+via screen hash) check old vs new

Tile-map display shows alpha-tiles as flipped. expected or bug?
