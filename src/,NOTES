Reinstate some control using keys.
Type for 8-bit regs & shared Set/get effects.

6bit col from PPU; convert to RGB via fixed mapping in UsingSDL
Hash pictures (256x240 6bit cols) for regression. and logging

Emu: ensure emitted pixels are in order and cover all 256x240

Remove deepseq etc
Better interface between Emu and UsingSDL (Action) allow logging
Count number of vmem reads when gen picture - show in per frame log

Have PPU generate picture from nametable
PPU generate picture using pallet info in nametable(attribute part)

Dump nametable for game-attract screen and level 1 from honesty
Run dumped nametable in amnesty, for visual comparison

PPU use regs to track h/v scan counting
Speed up! (do I need compilation already!)


Run without SDL

Use regs to store key-last-state and so detect edges.
Key/Reg to control other features such as flip.
AvsB reg when refactoring code to visually (+via screen hash) check old vs new

Tile-map display shows alpha-tiles as flipped. expected or bug?
